## Explain data binding in Angular

- According to AngularJS.org, "Data-binding in Angular apps is the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components. The way that Angular implements data-binding lets you treat the model as the single-source-of-truth in your application. The view is a projection of the model at all times. When the model changes, the view reflects the change and vice versa."
- There are two ways of data binding:
1. Data mining in classical template systems.
2. Data binding in angular templates.

## What are directives in Angular

- A core feature of Angular, directives are attributes that allows you to invent new HTML syntax, specific to your application. They are essentially functions that execute when the Angular compiler finds them in the DOM.
- Some of the most commonly used directives are `ng-app`, `ng-controller` and `ng-repeat`. 
- The different types of directives are: 
	 - Element directives.
	 - Attribute directives.
	 - CSS class directives.
	 - Comment directives.
